# Axe Accessibiliy Linter extension for Zed
The [Axe Accessibility Linter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=deque-systems.vscode-axe-linter) VS Code extension is a handy tool that warns you of accessibility violations in code as you're writing it.

This is merely the [Zed](https://zed.dev) client for an *already-existing* copy of the Axe Accessibility Linter langauge server executable. You will need that executable in order for the extension to work!

### Instructions on how to acquire the language server executable 👉 [tplewe.com/axe-linter-in-neovim](https://tplewe.com/axe-linter-in-neovim)
